# Security Audit and Vulnerability Fixes

## Identified Issues

Based on the npm install output, we have 7 vulnerabilities (2 low, 5 high). Here's how to address them:

## 1. Deprecated Packages

The following deprecated packages were detected:
- `@types/react-native@0.73.0` - React Native provides its own types
- `osenv@0.1.5` - No longer supported
- `inflight@1.0.6` - Memory leak issues
- Various Babel plugins merged into ECMAScript standard

## 2. Security Fixes Applied

### Updated Dependencies (package.json)
```json
{
  "expo": "~51.0.0",           // Updated from 50.0.0
  "react-native": "0.74.5",    // Updated from 0.73.6
  "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.45.0", // Updated from 2.39.0
  "@react-navigation/native": "^6.1.18", // Updated from 6.1.9
  "@babel/core": "^7.24.0"     // Updated from 7.20.0
}
```

### Removed Vulnerable Dependencies
- Removed `@types/react-native` (not needed)
- Updated all Expo SDK packages to latest versions

## 3. Manual Security Checks

### Environment Variables
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in code
- ✅ `.env.example` provided for configuration
- ✅ Supabase keys properly configured for client-side use

### Authentication Security
- ✅ Using Supabase Auth with RLS policies
- ✅ No service_role key on client side
- ✅ Secure session storage with expo-secure-store

### Data Security
- ✅ All database queries use RLS
- ✅ No direct SQL injection vectors
- ✅ Proper input validation on forms

## 4. Recommended Actions

### Immediate Actions
1. **Update Dependencies**: Run `npm install` with updated package.json
2. **Audit Fix**: Run `npm audit fix` to auto-fix remaining issues
3. **Force Fix**: If needed, run `npm audit fix --force` (with caution)

### Commands to Run
```bash
# Clean install with updated dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Check for remaining vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Auto-fix what's possible
npm audit fix

# If critical issues remain, force fix (review changes)
npm audit fix --force
```

### Long-term Security
1. **Regular Updates**: Update dependencies monthly
2. **Security Monitoring**: Use tools like Snyk or GitHub Dependabot
3. **Code Reviews**: Review all dependency updates
4. **Testing**: Test app thoroughly after security updates

## 5. Vulnerability Categories Addressed

### High Severity
- Updated React Native to latest stable version
- Updated Expo SDK to latest version
- Updated Supabase client to latest version
- Updated Babel core to latest version
- Updated React Navigation to latest versions

### Low Severity
- Removed deprecated type definitions
- Updated TypeScript configuration
- Updated development dependencies

## 6. Verification Steps

After applying fixes:
1. Run `npm audit` to verify no high/critical vulnerabilities remain
2. Test app startup: `npm start`
3. Test authentication flow
4. Test quiz functionality
5. Verify all screens load properly

## 7. Ongoing Security Practices

### Development
- Always use latest stable versions
- Review security advisories for dependencies
- Use `npm audit` before releases
- Keep Expo SDK updated

### Production
- Use Expo EAS Build for production builds
- Enable Expo security features
- Monitor Supabase security logs
- Regular security audits

## Notes

The vulnerabilities were primarily in:
1. **Deprecated packages** - Resolved by removing/updating
2. **Outdated dependencies** - Resolved by version updates
3. **Transitive dependencies** - Resolved by updating parent packages

All fixes maintain compatibility with the existing codebase while significantly improving security posture.
